# The Feature Representations of Transfer Learning and Gradient-Based Meta-Learning Techniques 

This is the code repository associated with the 2021 NeurIPS meta-learning workshop paper "A Preliminary Study on the Feature Representations of Transfer Learning and Gradient-Based Meta-Learning Techniques". 


The pre-training and meta-learning in few-shot image classifications settings can be run by executing the *main.py* script.
